This analysis shows growth curves for vocabulary size (the number of words on the CDI form that a child produces or understands), for different languages, forms, and measures.
For some datasets, it is possible to compare growth curves across different
demographic groups (birth order, race, ethnicity, gender, mother's education). 
To fit quantiles, use the "add model fits" button.
See below for more details and an important disclaimer about clinical usage.
