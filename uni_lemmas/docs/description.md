This analysis shows cached growth curves for words on the CDI forms of various languages. Words are selected using "uni-lemmas" (universal lemmas"), which are cross-linguistic conceptual mappings (as described in Section 3.1.5 of the [Wordbank Book](https://langcog.github.io/wordbank-book/methods-and-data.html)). Some unilemmas are found across forms for many different languages while others are found on only a small number. Unilemma coverage across languages is incomplete and may contain errors/difficult judgment calls.
